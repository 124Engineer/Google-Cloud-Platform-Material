# Compute Engine

When working with GCP Compute Engine (or GCE) you have several choices.  These include the following:

1) Create a new VM instance using a default GCP template.
2) Create a new VM instance using an image or snapshot file.
3) Create a new VM instance using a template file from the GCP Marketplace.
4) Migrate a VM from on premise, Azure or AWS using the [Cloud Migration tools](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/4.11/concepts/architecture/gcp-reference-architecture). Example architecture shown below.
