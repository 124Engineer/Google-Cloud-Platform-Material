Use Dataplex to build a data mesh architecture (image above from [GCP whitepaper](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-essentials/blob/master/7_sample_data/images/gcp-data-mesh-example.png))
- Dataplex includes features, such as a lake, zones, and other assets which you use to build a data mesh.
- See GCP Whitepaper in this directory for architecture and examples.

## What is a DataMesh?

A data mesh is an organizational and technical approach that decentralizes data ownership among domain data owners. 
These owners provide the **data as a product** in a standard way and facilitate communication among different parts of the organization 
to distribute datasets across different locations.
