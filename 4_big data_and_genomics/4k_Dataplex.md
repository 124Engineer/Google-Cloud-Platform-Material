from the GCP docs *"You can use Dataplex to build a data mesh architecture. The GCP Dataplex service includes features, such as a lake, zones, and assets, to build a data mesh.
A data mesh is an organizational and technical approach that decentralizes data ownership among domain data owners. These owners provide the data as a product in a standard way and facilitate communication among different parts of the 
organization to distribute datasets across different locations."*
