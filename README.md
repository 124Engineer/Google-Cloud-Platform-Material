# GCP Essentials Course Scripts, Links and Examples

This repository contains sample code, links and scripts for working with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. Included technologies are for storage, database, big data and more.  This repository is designed to be used in conjunction with these LinkedIn Learning courses: 
- **"GCP Essentials"** - [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/google-cloud-platform-essential-training-3)
- **"GCP Enterprise Essentials"** - [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/google-cloud-platform-for-enterprise-essential-training)
- **"GCP Machine Learning Essentials"** - [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/google-cloud-platform-for-machine-learning-essential-training)

Examples use the GPC scripting tools (`gcloud`, `gsutil`, `bq`...) and sometimes also the Python API with the GCP SDK.  You can work with GCP services in many programming langauges, such as Java, Go, Node and others. See this link for the GCP SDK to see examples for other programming languages: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/

## Other GCP Repos & Courses

Additionally, I have created other reporisitories and courses on GCP topics.  These artifacts contains sample code and scripts for working with Google Cloud Platform services for bioinformatics use cases and also for machine learning.  

- **GCP-ML** --> For code samples for GCP machine learning see this repository: https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-ml
- **GCP-for-Bioinformatics** --> For links, screencasts, jupyter notebooks or example workflows (Terra/WDL, Nextflow/NF, Galaxy Project...) for bioinformatics use cases, see this repository: https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-for-bioinformatics
